# Bitcoin Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of Bitcoin data to understand its relationship with search volume and price trends. Additionally, it explores similar patterns in other high-demand stocks like Tesla.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Utilized Python and Pandas for comprehensive data analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Matplotlib for visually representing trends and correlations.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Employed `.describe()` to obtain key statistical insights.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Utilized `.resample()` to standardize time-series data.
- **Missing Value Detection**: Identified and managed missing values using `.isna().values.sum()`.
- **Chart Customization**: Fine-tuned Matplotlib charts for optimal aesthetics and clarity.
- **Seasonality Detection**: Utilized `.grid()` to visually identify seasonality patterns in time-series data.
